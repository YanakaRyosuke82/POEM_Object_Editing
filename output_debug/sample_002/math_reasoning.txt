Okay, so I need to figure out how to create a 3x3 transformation matrix that makes the cat 12% smaller. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The user wants the cat to be scaled down by 12%. Scaling in transformations usually involves scaling factors for the x and y axes. Since the cat should be smaller, the scaling factors will be less than 1.

I remember that the scale transformation matrix is a diagonal matrix where the diagonal elements are the scaling factors for x, y, and z (which is 1 for 2D transformations). So, the matrix looks like this:

[[sx, 0, 0],
 [0, sy, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

In this case, since the cat should be 12% smaller, that means the new size is 88% of the original. So, sx and sy should both be 0.88.

I don't think there are any other transformations needed here, like rotation or translation, because the problem only mentions scaling. So, the matrix should just be a scaling matrix with 0.88 on the diagonal.

Let me double-check: 12% smaller means multiplying by 0.88, which is correct. So the matrix should be:

[[0.88, 0.00, 0.00],
 [0.00, 0.88, 0.00],
 [0.00, 0.00, 1.00]]

I think that's it. No other transformations are needed, so the final matrix is just the scaling matrix with 0.88 as the scaling factors for both x and y.

To make the cat 12% smaller, we'll apply a scaling transformation with a scale factor of 0.88 (since 100% - 12% = 88%). The transformation matrix for scaling is:

<<MATRIX_START>>
[[0.88  0.00  0.00]
 [0.00  0.88  0.00]
 [0.00  0.00  1.00]]
<<MATRIX_END>>
