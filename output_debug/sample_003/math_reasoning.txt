Okay, so I need to figure out the transformation matrix to make the cat 12% smaller than the dog. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user wants the cat to be scaled down by 12%. That means the cat's size should be 88% of the dog's size because 100% - 12% = 88%. So, the scaling factor for both x and y axes should be 0.88.

Looking at the available transformations, scaling is done using a scale matrix. The scale matrix is structured as:
[[sx, 0, 0],
 [0, sy, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Since we need uniform scaling (both x and y by the same factor), sx and sy will both be 0.88.

I don't need to consider other transformations like translation, rotation, shear, or flip because the problem only mentions scaling. So, the matrix will only involve scaling.

Now, putting it all together, the transformation matrix should be:
[[0.88, 0.00, 0.00],
 [0.00, 0.88, 0.00],
 [0.00, 0.00, 1.00]]

I also need to specify the object ID. Since the cat is the one being transformed, and assuming the cat is object ID 1, I'll include that as well.

I should double-check the format: 3x3 matrix with floats, two spaces between numbers, and the correct tokens for the matrix and object ID. Everything seems to fit, so I'm ready to present the answer.

To make the cat 12% smaller than the dog, we apply a scaling transformation with a factor of 0.88 (100% - 12% = 88%) to the cat.

<<MATRIX_START>>
[[0.88  0.00  0.00]
 [0.00  0.88  0.00]
 [0.00  0.00  1.00]]
<<MATRIX_END>>
