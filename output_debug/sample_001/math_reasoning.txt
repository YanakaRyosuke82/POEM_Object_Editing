Okay, so I need to figure out how to create a 3x3 transformation matrix that makes the dog 12% larger. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that scaling in transformations is done using a scale matrix. The general form of a scale matrix is:

[[sx, 0, 0],
 [0, sy, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Here, sx and sy are the scaling factors along the x and y axes, respectively. Since the problem says to make the dog 12% larger, I need to determine what scaling factor corresponds to a 12% increase.

A 12% increase means the new size is 100% + 12% = 112% of the original size. To convert this percentage into a scaling factor, I divide by 100. So, 112% becomes 1.12. Therefore, both sx and sy should be 1.12 because we want to scale the dog uniformly in both dimensions.

Putting this into the scale matrix, we get:

[[1.12, 0.00, 0.00],
 [0.00, 1.12, 0.00],
 [0.00, 0.00, 1.00]]

I should double-check to make sure I'm using the correct format. The matrix needs to be 3x3, all numbers as floats with two decimal places, and exactly two spaces between each number. Also, the image origin is top-left, with X right and Y down, but since scaling doesn't affect the origin or axes direction, I don't need to adjust anything else.

So, the final matrix should look like the one above, ensuring all numbers are in the correct format and the matrix is properly structured.

To scale the dog 12% larger, we use a uniform scale matrix with a factor of 1.12.

<<MATRIX_START>>
[[1.12  0.00  0.00]
 [0.00  1.12  0.00]
 [0.00  0.00  1.00]]
<<MATRIX_END>>
