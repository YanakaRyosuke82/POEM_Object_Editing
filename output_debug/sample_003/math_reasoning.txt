To translate the pizza 20 px east, we need to use a translation matrix. The translation matrix for translating an object by \( (t_x, t_y) \) is given by:

\[
T = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & t_x \\
0 & 1 & t_y \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

In this case, we are translating the pizza 20 px east, so \( t_x = 20 \) and \( t_y = 0 \). The translation matrix becomes:

\[
T = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 20 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Let's write the Python code to create this translation matrix using sympy.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the translation values
tx = 20
ty = 0

# Create the translation matrix
translation_matrix = sp.Matrix([
    [1, 0, tx],
    [0, 1, ty],
    [0, 0, 1]
])

print(translation_matrix)
```
```output
Matrix([[1, 0, 20], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]])
```
The translation matrix for translating the pizza 20 px east is:

\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 20 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}}
\]

This matrix will move the pizza 20 px to the right on the x-axis. If you need to perform any other transformations or combinations of transformations, you can use this matrix in conjunction with the appropriate transformation matrices for rotation, scaling, or shear.
