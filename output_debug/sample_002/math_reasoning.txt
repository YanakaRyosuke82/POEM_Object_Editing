To make the cat 12% smaller, we need to apply a scaling transformation. The scaling factor for both width and height will be \(1 - 0.12 = 0.88\). The transformation matrix for scaling is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
s_x & 0 & 0 \\
0 & s_y & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

In this case, \(s_x = s_y = 0.88\). The transformation matrix will be:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
0.88 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0.88 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Let's confirm this by applying the transformation to the cat's dimensions. The original dimensions of the cat are width = 0.611 and height = 0.813. After scaling, the new dimensions will be:

\[
\text{New width} = 0.611 \times 0.88
\]
\[
\text{New height} = 0.813 \times 0.88
\]

We can use Python to calculate these values.
```python
# Original dimensions of the cat
original_width = 0.611
original_height = 0.813

# Scaling factor
scaling_factor = 0.88

# New dimensions after scaling
new_width = original_width * scaling_factor
new_height = original_height * scaling_factor

print(((new_width, new_height)))
```
```output
(0.5376800000000001, 0.71004)
```
After applying the scaling transformation, the new dimensions of the cat are approximately width = 0.538 and height = 0.710. This confirms that the cat is now 12% smaller.

The transformation matrix for scaling the cat by 12% is:

\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 0.88 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.88 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}}
\]
