To make the dog 12% larger, we need to apply a scaling transformation to the dog's dimensions. The scaling factor for both width and height will be \(1 + 0.12 = 1.12\). The transformation matrix for scaling is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
s_x & 0 & 0 \\
0 & s_y & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

In this case, \(s_x = s_y = 1.12\), so the transformation matrix is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
1.12 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1.12 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Let's confirm this by applying the transformation matrix to the dog's dimensions. The original dimensions of the dog are width = 0.465 and height = 0.716. After scaling, the new dimensions will be:

\[
\text{New width} = 0.465 \times 1.12
\]
\[
\text{New height} = 0.716 \times 1.12
\]

We can use Python to calculate these values.
```python
# Original dimensions of the dog
original_width = 0.465
original_height = 0.716

# Scaling factor
scaling_factor = 1.12

# New dimensions after scaling
new_width = original_width * scaling_factor
new_height = original_height * scaling_factor

print(((new_width, new_height)))
```
```output
(0.5208000000000001, 0.8028800000000001)
```
After applying the scaling transformation, the new dimensions of the dog are:

- New width: \(0.5208\)
- New height: \(0.8029\)

The transformation matrix for scaling the dog by 12% is:

\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 1.12 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1.12 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}}
\]
