Okay, so I need to figure out how to create a 3x3 transformation matrix that scales the cat object by 12% smaller. Let me start by understanding what scaling means in this context.

Scaling a 3D object involves changing its size along each axis. Since the problem doesn't specify different scaling factors for x and y, I assume it's a uniform scaling. So, both the x and y scales will be the same.

A 12% reduction means the object will be 88% of its original size because 100% - 12% = 88%. To express this as a scaling factor, I convert 88% to a decimal, which is 0.88.

Looking at the available transformations, the scale matrix is given by:
[[sx 0 0],
 [0 sy 0],
 [0 0 1]]

Since we're scaling both x and y by 0.88, the matrix becomes:
[[0.88 0.00 0.00],
 [0.00 0.88 0.00],
 [0.00 0.00 1.00]]

I need to ensure all numbers are floats with two decimal places. So, 0.88 remains as is, and zeros are written as 0.00.

The object ID is specified as 1, so I include that as well.

Finally, I structure the response by first explaining my reasoning concisely, then outputting the matrix within the specified tokens, followed by the object ID within its tokens.

The transformation is a scaling by 0.88 (12% smaller) in both x and y directions. The matrix is a scale matrix with sx=0.88 and sy=0.88.
