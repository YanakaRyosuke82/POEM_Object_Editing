Okay, so I need to figure out the transformation matrix for making the cat 12% smaller. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that scaling an object involves using a scale matrix. The scale matrix is given by [[sx, 0, 0], [0, sy, 0], [0, 0, 1]], where sx and sy are the scaling factors in the x and y directions, respectively.

Since the cat needs to be 12% smaller, that means it's being scaled down by 12%. So, the scaling factor isn't 12% of the original size, but rather 88% because 100% - 12% = 88%. Therefore, sx and sy should both be 0.88.

I should make sure that the matrix is a 3x3 numpy array with float values. Each number should be a float, like 0.88 instead of 88/100. Also, the matrix needs to be properly formatted with exactly two spaces between each number.

The object ID is required, but since it's not specified, I'll assume it's object 1.

Putting it all together, the scale matrix will have 0.88 on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere, with 1 in the bottom right corner as per the transformation matrix standards.

To make the cat 12% smaller, we'll use a scaling transformation with a scale factor of 0.88 (100% - 12% = 88%).

<<MATRIX_START>>
[[0.88  0.00  0.00]
 [0.00  0.88  0.00]
 [0.00  0.00  1.00]]
