Okay, so I need to figure out the transformation matrix to make the dog 15% smaller than the cat while keeping the cat unchanged. First, I should understand what a 15% reduction means. If the cat is the reference, then the dog's size should be 85% of the cat's size because 100% - 15% = 85%. 

Since scaling in transformation matrices uses scale factors, I'll use 0.85 for both the x and y axes. The scale matrix is a diagonal matrix where the diagonal elements are the scale factors. So, the matrix should have 0.85 at (0,0) and (1,1), and 1 at (2,2) to keep it a valid transformation matrix.

I also need to ensure that the translation part remains zero because the dog should stay in the same place relative to the cat. So, the translation components (tx and ty) are both 0. 

Putting it all together, the matrix should be:
[[0.85, 0.00, 0.00],
 [0.00, 0.85, 0.00],
 [0.00, 0.00, 1.00]]

And the object ID is 1, assuming the dog is object 1.

To scale the dog to 85% of its original size (15% smaller), we apply a uniform scale transformation. The scale factor is 0.85 for both x and y axes.

 [0.00  0.85  0.00]
 [0.00  0.00  1.00]]
