Okay, so I need to figure out the transformation matrix to make the cat 12% smaller. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem says the cat should be 12% smaller. That means we're scaling it down. In transformation matrices, scaling is done using a scale matrix. The scale matrix is a diagonal matrix where the diagonal elements are the scaling factors for x and y, and the last element is 1.

Since we're reducing the size by 12%, the scaling factor isn't 12% of the original size but rather 88% of it. Because 100% - 12% = 88%. So, the scaling factor sx and sy should both be 0.88.

Looking at the available transformations, the scale matrix is [[sx, 0, 0], [0, sy, 0], [0, 0, 1]]. Plugging in sx and sy as 0.88, the matrix becomes [[0.88, 0, 0], [0, 0.88, 0], [0, 0, 1]].

I should make sure all numbers are floats and formatted correctly with two decimal places. So, 0.88 is already at two decimal places. The matrix should be 3x3, and each number should have exactly two spaces between them.

Also, the object ID needs to be specified. The problem mentions the cat, which is object #1, so the ID is 1.

Putting it all together, the reasoning is that a 12% reduction means scaling by 0.88 in both x and y directions. The matrix is then constructed accordingly, and the object ID is identified.

To make the cat 12% smaller, we apply a scaling transformation with a factor of 0.88 (since 100% - 12% = 88%). The scale matrix is used with sx = sy = 0.88.

<<MATRIX_START>>
[[0.88  0.00  0.00]
 [0.00  0.88  0.00]
 [0.00  0.00  1.00]]
