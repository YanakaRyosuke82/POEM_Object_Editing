Okay, so I need to figure out the transformation matrix to make the dog 15% smaller than the cat while keeping it in the same place. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that scaling an object changes its size. The transformation matrix for scaling is a diagonal matrix where the diagonal elements are the scale factors for x and y, and 1 for the z-component since we're working in 2D. So, the basic scale matrix is [[sx, 0, 0], [0, sy, 0], [0, 0, 1]].

The problem states that the dog should be 15% smaller than the cat. That means the dog's size is 85% of the cat's size. So, the scale factor sx and sy should both be 0.85. This will reduce both the width and height by 15%, making the dog smaller while maintaining its proportions.

Since the transformation should keep the dog in the same place, there's no translation involved. So, the translation components (tx and ty) in the matrix should be 0. That means the matrix doesn't need any additional terms beyond the scaling.

Putting it all together, the transformation matrix should be a scaling matrix with sx = 0.85 and sy = 0.85. The rest of the elements remain as per the identity matrix except for the scaling factors.

I also need to make sure the matrix is formatted correctly with exactly two spaces between the numbers and all elements as floats. The object ID is 1, as specified.

So, the final matrix is a 3x3 array with 0.85 on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere, except for the last row which is [0, 0, 1].

To make the dog 15% smaller than the cat, we apply a scaling transformation with a factor of 0.85. The transformation matrix scales both x and y dimensions by 0.85 while keeping the object in the same position.
