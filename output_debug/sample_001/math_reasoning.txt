Okay, so I need to figure out how to make the dog 12% larger using a transformation matrix. Hmm, the available transformations include scaling, so I should use the scale transformation. 

The scale matrix is given as [[sx, 0, 0], [0, sy, 0], [0, 0, 1]]. To make the object 12% larger, I need to increase both the x and y scales by 12%. So, the scale factor should be 1 plus 12%, which is 1.12.

So, sx and sy will both be 1.12. That means the transformation matrix becomes:
[[1.12, 0, 0],
 [0, 1.12, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

I think that's correct because scaling both axes by 1.12 will uniformly increase the size of the dog by 12% in both width and height. 

Now, I also need to provide the object ID. Since the instruction is about the dog, I'll assume the object ID is 1. 

Putting it all together, the matrix should be as I wrote, and the object ID is 1.

To make the dog 12% larger, we apply a scaling transformation with a factor of 1.12 on both x and y axes.

<<MATRIX_START>>
[[1.12  0.00  0.00]
 [0.00  1.12  0.00]
 [0.00  0.00  1.00]]
<<MATRIX_END>>

<<OBJECT_ID_START>>1<<OBJECT_ID_END>>
