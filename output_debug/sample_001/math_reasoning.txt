Okay, so I need to figure out how to create a 3x3 transformation matrix that scales the dog object by 12% larger. Let me start by recalling the available transformations. The user mentioned scaling as one of the options, which is a good start.

Scaling in 2D transformations typically affects the x and y dimensions. The scale matrix is usually represented as [[sx, 0, 0], [0, sy, 0], [0, 0, 1]]. Since the transformation is to make the dog 12% larger, I need to determine the scaling factors sx and sy.

A 12% increase means the new size is 112% of the original. To convert that into a scaling factor, I divide 112 by 100, which gives 1.12. So both sx and sy should be 1.12 because we want to scale both width and height equally.

Now, putting this into the matrix format. The matrix should be 3x3 with floats, so each number should have two decimal places. The scaling matrix becomes:

[[1.12, 0.00, 0.00],
 [0.00, 1.12, 0.00],
 [0.00, 0.00, 1.00]]

I should make sure to follow the exact format, using two spaces between each number and enclosing the matrix within the specified tokens. Also, the object ID is required, but since the user didn't specify which object, I'll assume it's object 1.

Double-checking everything, the scaling factor is correct, the matrix format adheres to the rules, and the object ID is included properly. I think that's all set.

To scale the dog object by 12%, we use a scaling transformation matrix with sx = 1.12 and sy = 1.12.

<<MATRIX_START>>
[[1.12  0.00  0.00]
 [0.00  1.12  0.00]
 [0.00  0.00  1.00]]
<<MATRIX_END>>

<<OBJECT_ID_START>>1<<OBJECT_ID_END>>
